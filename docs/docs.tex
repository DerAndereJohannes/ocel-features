\section{Document Format}
The structure section will go over all the structures that are created in order for many of the feature extraction methods to function. Each structure will have information on input, context behind the structure and a sample image to demonstrate the output on a basic example.

The Feature sections go over feature extraction methods explored throughout the thesis on the topic. All features are aimed at being very general, applicable to any input ocel log. The descriptions will include the input, structures used, output, context and, if required, a very small basic visualization based on the examples that are found in the structures section. 
)

\section{Example OCEL}
The following log was taken from ... and will be used for the majority of examples in this document. Of course this log is very basic and will therefore not cover all edge cases that can occur in ocel logs. However, using the log, I hope to show the intuition of all structures and feature extraction methods.

\section{Structures}
\subsection{Object-Based}
\subsubsection{Object Interaction Graph}
\textbf{Description -} This \emph{undirected} graph simply places all objects on the graph as \emph{nodes} and assigns \emph{edges} based on whether an object interacted in the same event as the other.\\

\noindent \textbf{Context -} The goal of this graph is to provide a base graph that allows relationships between objects to be explored.
\\

\noindent\textbf{Strengths}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Very simple
	\item Allows for initial relationships between all objects
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\textbf{limitations}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Very high number of edges
	\item An object that interacts a lot with a target object is displayed the same as an object with very few interaction
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\textbf{Visual example}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/object-graph.png}
	\caption{Example of an Object Interaction Graph}
	\label{fig:object-graph}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Object Descendant Graph}
\textbf{Description -} This \emph{directed} graph places all objects on the graph as \emph{nodes} and assigns \emph{edges} based on whether an source object participated in the event where the target object participated in its first event. Note that this also means that objects that were created in the same event are descendants of each other.\\

\noindent \textbf{Context -} The goal of this graph is to take advantage of the time dimension in order to separate objects from each other. This helps greatly reduce the degree of each of the nodes.
\\

\noindent\textbf{Strengths}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item More focussed graph on objects that are related by the time dimension.
	\item Direction adds ability to easily segment further (via connectedness) and find independence between objects.
	\item Allows for disconnected subgraphs
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\textbf{limitations}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Ignores object relationships related to frequency of interaction with each other.
	\item Can cause many objects to have no edges.
	\item General objects (eg. SYSTEM user) will have a very large descendants list.)
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\textbf{Visual example}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/descendants.png}
	\caption{Example of an Object Descendant Graph}
	\label{fig:descendant-graph}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Object Lineage Graph}
\textbf{Description -} The Object Lineage Graph is a representation of the entire object space of the event log in terms of a directed, labelled property graph. It is a natural progression of the object and descendants graphs in terms of defining each of the edges that exist in terms of a well defined property label graph. This can be formally defined by using triplets where a relationship gets defined by a source, relation, target. ie. (source\_obj, relation, target\_obj)\\
\noindent\textbf{Context -} The goal of this graph is to use the information gained from the ocel log on top of the object relation graph in order to separate and define the edges such that they can be handled differently. Also if the main focus of a feature is specific to a few types of relations, the remaining relations can be ignored. TOCONSIDER: add relations w.r.t the finishing event? Let users define a relationship based on certain event? Does it make sense to define an ontology?\\
\noindent\textbf{Strengths}\\
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Allows for the generation of the graph to be completed through 1 iteration of the ocel log.
	\item Allows for full use of the edges that exist in the entire ocel log.
	\item Allows for separation and filtering of particular relations.
	\item Creates a hierarchy of relations between objects in terms of "closeness" or "relatedness" to each other.
	\item Very simple to parallelize the generation of the graph by prioritizing the edges found at the earliest stage.
\end{enumerate}
\noindent\textbf{Limitations}\\
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The graph only takes into account the relations with respect to object generation.
	\item As the relations are mainly defined by the starting event, relations with respect to all other events are listed under "unrelated" which may not be the case.
\end{enumerate}
\noindent\textbf{Visual Example}

\end{figure}

\section{Relationships}
\subsection{Interaction}
\noindent\textbf{Description -} The most basic type of relationship. The interaction relationship is applied when an object interacts in the same event as the other. In a directed graph, the arc goes both ways.

\noindent\textbf{Definition -}
\subsection{Descendants/Ancestors}
\noindent\textbf{Description -} An object $o_1$ is a descendant of another if the other object $o_2$ is an ancestor of the object. An ancestor means that the object participated in the event where the descendant is first seen in the log. The only exception being when both objects start with the same event. 

\noindent\textbf{Definition -}
\subsection{Co-Birth}
\noindent\textbf{Description -} Two objects have the co-birth relation with each other when both have the same starting event.


\noindent\textbf{Definition -}
\subsection{Co-Death}
\noindent\textbf{Description -} Two objects have the co-birth relation with each other when both have the same ending event.


\noindent\textbf{Definition -}
\subsection{Merge}
\noindent\textbf{Description -} An object $o_1$ merges with object $o_2$ if both objects are of the same type, $o_2$ participates in $o_1$'s final event and $o_2$ still has future events.


\noindent\textbf{Definition -}
\subsection{Inheritance}
\noindent\textbf{Description -} An object $o_1$ inherits from object $o_2$ if the starting event of $o_1$ is the same as the ending event from $o_2$.

\noindent\textbf{Definition -}
\subsection{Killer}
\noindent\textbf{Description -} A killer object $o_1$ kills object $o_2$ if it participates in the last event of $o_2$ while not dying at the same time

\noindent\textbf{Definition -}
\subsection{Peeling}
\noindent\textbf{Description -} An object $o_1$ peels $o_2$ when events between both objects are only executed between the two objects.

\noindent\textbf{Definition -}
\subsection{Minion}
\noindent\textbf{Description -} An object $o_1$ is a minion of $o_2$ if all events participated by $o_1$ are also participated by $o_2$. $o_2$ must also have other events without $o_1$.

\noindent\textbf{Definition -}
